              hi.
              <br>
              After SPM, I have applied for Khazanah, Petronas, Sime Darby, TNB, Bank Negara and Shell scholarship programmes. Khazanah is the only one (among those I have mentioned) that sponsors the course of my preference, biotechnology. The highest stage I have reached is 3rd Stage in Shell Scholarship Programme. Most of those I have been rejected at Stage 2. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Application process may vary according to sponsors. For Shell Scholarship, there are 4 stages which is online application, online assesment, on-demand video interview (using HireVue) and final interview.
              <br>
              <br>
              During online application, you’ll be asked to fill in your best co-curriculum achievement, field of interest and submit an essay. For making things easier, complete your CV or resume so you will be clearer about your achievements level. Besides, do scan important documents, certificates, passport photo and save it in PDF format. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Some may be unsure what course to choose and so am I at that period. I have been asking a lot of questions to experienced people that I have met about their career and degree studies. Experience sharing in YouTube helped too. No one knows better than the one who really experienced it, right? It is totally okay if you feel like the course doesn't suits you because you have the time to change it until the form is submitted. Make sure you love what you choose! For the essay part, I used my personal statement that was written before.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Stage 2</b> is quite challenging for me in most scholarships that I have applied. Some would require you to do verbal test, numerical test and abstract test. What I can see is these tests wanted to know your critical thinking level and how you make decision under pressure. Time is limited and short period was given along with tens of questions (it is not impossible to answer all of them confidently but quite challenging!). There are some sample questions on the Internet that you can try too. I wish that I know about these tests earlier and prepare well. Post 2nd stage, I have received invitation to Stage 3 only by Shell.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Stage 3 </b>is on-demand video interview. This is quite hard if you have stage fright or camera shyness. The best way is get over the fear and be confident! I know it sounds easier to say, but we will have to face lots more interviews and human interactions. Confidence, eye contact and points are important! Next, the questions are more to asking about your experiences in certain situation. For example, “Describe a time when you influenced others and gain commitment from them”. I find answers are best in story-telling mode and not scripted (will get more nervous if you stuttered). Surely, you can prepare points to be said and believe in yourself! 
              <br>
              <br>
              I can’t tell much about <b>Stage 4</b> because I didn’t reach there yet. Basically, you will be interviewed by the Scholarship Board of Trustees on scenario-based questions and your academic & leadership experiences. I’ll do my best to get a degree scholarship next year using Pre-U result insyaAllah! Pray for me too.
              <br>
              <br>
              Gratefully, I’ve been offered to my dream local university, University Malaya for Foundation in Life Science through UPU. I believe this is the best path written for me and I’m more than glad!
              <br>
              <br>
              Overall, If you are reading this and are still in high school, do your utter best in academic and most importantly, in gaining extraordinary inspiring experiences. Always strive for the best wherever life put you into. Wish you all the best! :)
