          <p>
            I applied for specifically in Yayasan Sime Darby Scholarship, specifically in YSD Excellence Scholarship Programmes. There are four programmes in total, which are:
            <br>
            -	Pre-University Scholarship Programme (China)
            <br>
            -	Pre-University Scholarship Programme (United Kingdom)
            <br>
            -	Undergraduate Scholarship Programme (Indonesia)
            <br>
            -	Undergraduate Scholarship Programme (Malaysia)              
              <br>
              <br>
              It is a programme that supports well-rounded students with outstanding academic achievements, active involvement in extracurricular activities and participation in community service. The minimum requirements for the Pre-University Scholarship Programme is to obtain at least 7As (A+ and As only). I applied for Pre-University Scholarship Programme (United Kingdom). The application for the sponsorship is open for application starting from 5 March 2020 and it ended on 23 March 2020. I found out about Yayasan Sime Darby from Dr Liyana Amalina. I filled out the forms that were given and I attached some documents that are required by Yayasan Sime Darby.
              <br>
              <br>
              Few days after sending my application, I received an email from Yayasan Sime Darby saying that I am qualified to the second stage of the interview. They invited me to do online assessments that includes Verbal Reasoning Test which is an english assessment that consists of 30 questions and Numerical Reasoning Test which is a mathematics assessment which consists of 18 questions. Time given for each assessment is 17 minutes. The English assessment asked about grammar, vocabulary and understanding. Meanwhile, the mathematics assessment asked about some simple calculation and basic mathematical knowledge. Both of the tests only include multiple-choice questions.               
              <br>
              <br>
              There are also a lot of sample questions similar to the ones that you will answer on the internet, therefore, I advise you to practice first so that you will understand the structure of the question and how to answer each question accurately, and please answer the questions in calm state. Do not be nervous and don’t think too much about whether your answer is right or wrong. This is what I did, and I ended up being anxious and doubting my own answers which lead me to change my answers several times. Be confident with your answers. I was also running out of time for the questions since the time is quite short, so you need to practice answering each question in less than a minute, so that you won’t run out of time and panic during the test.              
              <br>
              <br>
              The results of the online ability test will be announced announce a few weeks after, and we were told to be alert of our emails. Unfortunately, I failed to get into third stage of the interview, so I got an email from them saying that I wasn’t qualified. I was quite disheartened and a little sad, but I believe there is another path that is better for me.
