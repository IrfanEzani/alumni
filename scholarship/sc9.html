            Hello! <br>
            I am writing to give you some tips and my experience in applying scholarships + what you should/can do before, during and after SPM. 
              <br>
              <br>
             <b>BEFORE : </b>
              <br>
              <br>
              First of all, before the nerve-wrecking week. <br>
                - Please please PLEASE do your preparation as best as you can. <br>
                - Perbanyakkan doa. <br>
                - Work your smartest (and hardest). <br>
                - Finish ALL the past year questions, familiarise yourself with the topic and the pattern of the    questions. <br>
                - Focus on things that frequently appears in past exams (preferably 2-3 years before). <br>
                - And memorise important facts, CONCEPTS, formulas and don’t take things lightly. <br>
                - But don’t stress yourself out(!!!). At this point, you need the energy and effort, the motivation, and faith and doa. Combine these three and if Allah wills, you’re good.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>DURING : </b>
              <br>
              <br>
                - Perbanyakkan doa. Perbanyakkan minta Allah tolong. Kita yakin kita dah usaha 100% or yang terbaik, then serahkan semua kepada Allah. <br>
                - Write on small papers about things that is very IMPORTANT to remember during exams.<br>
                - Don’t stress (again).<br>
                - Don’t stay up all night/ stay lewat malam to study. Your brain doesn’t even work that well during that hour and you end up tak ingat some of the things you read, and you don’t have enough energy to jawab exam. <br>
                - Don’t bincang soalan lepas habis each paper. You need to move forward. Benda dah lepas, jangan fikir. Move forward. You have another paper to jawab. Focus on that.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>AFTER : </b>
              <br>
              <br>
              - Enjoy!!! Literally. Enjoy yourself. You’ve worked hard. Take some months to do things that makes you happy (or not doing anything, if you prefer so). <br>
                - Do things that will benefit you in your future. Etc., learn new languages, read, learn new things (programming, etc.) <br>
                - Polish your english & maths skills. (!!!!) Most interview questions tend to focus on these 2 things to evaluate you. <br> 
                - Don’t beat yourself up over your result and don’t be sad over it. That is the best for you. Rezeki orang lain lain. Maybe it’s not your time yet. Banyakkan berdoa. Allah knows the best. Try to accept that this is the best for you. (I know it’s hard.) <br>
                - Spend a lot of time with your family. Always. Cherish the time around them before you get into university. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>SCHOLARSHIP : </b>
              <br>
              <br>
              - Study each and every single scholarships there is. (Requirements, opening dates, closing dates.) <br>
                - By every single scholarships, i really do mean each single ones. Yang tak famous pun, just study it. Like I said rezeki kat mana, kita tak tahu. <br>
                - P R E P A R E  the documents that are important for application!!! (result SPM, salinan IC parents and diri sendiri, sijil koku, list of achivements, slip gaji parents, etc.) <br>
                - The things that you do in kelas PD. Tu sangat berguna. Jangan ambil ringan. <br>
                - Try every single scholarships that meets the requirements. Mostly dia minta minimum 8As (A+ and As only). <br>
                - Again, banyakkan doa. <br>
                - Study for the evaluation stage in interviews too. Jangan ambil evaluation tests as something ringan. <br>
                - Don’t be nervous in interview. Be confident, but not sombong/angkat bakul. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>DONT DO : </b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Some of the things that I wish I can change during the preparation for SPM is that I wish had more motivation to revise and to study. I have a lot of time, but I let the stress get into my mind so I was surrounded by negative thoughts and that really disrupt everything. So please avoid negative thoughts from getting to you and stay positive (and healthy) as much as you can. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I also didn’t polish enough of my basic CONCEPTS (yang dah belajar masa F1-F3) so please master that at least 2/1 month(s) before SPM. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Jangan malu untuk tanya lecturers. Always always ALWAYS go on one to one session after each class if you don’t understand. Don’t keep the questions to yourself or ada mindset macam ‘takpelah nantilah tanya. Sempat lagi struggle before SPM ni.’ 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is what I did, so please don’t repeat my mistake. That's all from me, wishing you all the best for your future life.Don’t be shy to DM me if you got any questions regarding anything. Much love, Fiq.
