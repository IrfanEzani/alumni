        <p>
          I applied for Yayasan Peneraju Sponsorship specifically in Peneraju Profesional Programme. It is professional certification scholarship programme for professional fields such as accounting, finance, information technology and more. I applied for professional accounting certification under CAT-ACCA qualification. The application for the sponsorship is open for application starting from 5 March 2020. I found out about Yayasan Peneraju from my friends. I applied using my SPM result.
          <br>
          <br>
          Few days after sending my application, I received an email from Yayasan Peneraju saying that I was invited to do online assessment that includes English assessment and mathematics assessment. Time given for each assessment is one and a half hours. The English assessment asked about grammar, vocabulary and understanding. Meanwhile, the mathematics assessment asked about some simple calculation and basic accounting knowledge.
          <br>
          <br>
          The assessment was followed by an interview few days later. They asked me to describe myself, my strength, my weaknesses, how do I overcome my weaknesses, when do I see myself in 10 years, why ACCA and some knowledge about the big accounting firm in Malaysia . My advice is to not worry about your answer because there is no right and wrong. But, you need to be honest. After the interview, they will ask you if you have any questions. Do ask questions. It means that you have done your study about them and you wanted to learn more. If they ask about the the scholarship provider itself, do not get any information wrong. You need to do some research about the scholarship provider and related topics before the interview.
          <br>
          <br>
          A few days later, I received another email stating that my application was successful and I was chosen as one of their scholars.
